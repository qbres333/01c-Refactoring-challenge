# Refactor Starter Code

## Description

The Internet has become the main source of information for those with a smart phone or computer, so it's critical that this information is available to and usable by both the able and disabled. In this project I refactored starter code, which means that language has been added to make the webpage accessible to those using assistive technology such as screen readers and braille keyboards. This will ensure that all who are looking for marketing/SEO services can make informed decisions.

## Installion
